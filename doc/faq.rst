Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Isn't this an overly elaborate solution for a simple problem?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Perhaps.  However, it Works For Meâ„¢.

You're obviously free to use what works for you, be that manually updating the
information in your editor or using a simpler approach such as shtool_'s
``version`` applet.

Do you accept template contributions?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Yes, if they are somewhat general.  And, it is a great way to have me maintain
template compatibility for you in case something changes in a future version.

Either open an issue_ or push them to a fork on GitHub_.
