versionah
=========

:program:`versionah` is a simple tool to help you — or more specifically *me*
— easily maintain version information for a project.  Its entire aim is to make
the act of displaying or bumping a project’s version number a thoughtless task.

All repetitive tasks should be easily automated, and :program:`versionah` is
just a little step in the right direction!

It is written in Python_, and requires v3.5 or later.  :program:`versionah` is
released under the `GPL v3`_
