:mod:`versionah`
================

:mod:`versionah` is a simple tool to help you, or more specifically *me*, easily
maintain version information for a project.  Its entire aim is to make the act
of displaying or bumping a project's version number a thoughtless task.

All repetitive tasks should be easily automated, and :mod:`versionah` is just a
little step in the right direction!

It is written in Python_, and requires v2.6 or later.  :mod:`versionah` is
released under the `GPL v3`_
