Background
==========

I maintain a large number of projects, both my toy stuff on GitHub_ and more
serious things at the office.  While skipping around in my editor to increase a
version number I came to the obvious realisation that I shouldn't be doing this
manually.

Bumping or querying version numbers should be a zero thought process.  I
shouldn't need to remember the :abbr:`RegExp (Regular Expression)` needed to
make my editor jump to the version identifier in a particular file type.  I
shouldn't need to resort to various :kbd:`C-a` and :kbd:`C-x` contortions in
vim_ or formulating complicated lisp functions with ``number-to-string`` and
``string-to-number`` in emacs_.

Now `versionah` is born, and I should be able to realise those dreams!

Version numbers
===============

This - for some - is a very complicated topic, but not for me.  Version numbers
are made of three components; major, minor and micro.  All three components are
natural numbers, there are no exceptions.

If you find version numbers like 0.6c11 acceptable then `versionah` is not for
you.

.. note::

   If you like version numbers with two or four integer components then
   `versionah` can be for you too.  Support was added in 0.6.0, but that doesn't
   mean you have to use it!

PEP 386
~~~~~~~

The version numbering scheme supported by `versionah` is a very small subset of
``LooseVersion`` defined in :pep:`386`.  It isn't compliant with
``StrictVersion`` due to the 4 component support, but support for packages in
the wild is much more important to me.

Versioning policy
-----------------

Beyond the simple rule above you're free to do as you wish, but consider this a
plea for a sane versioning policy.

  .. blockdiag::

    diagram {
      group A {
        label = "Bug-fix releases";
        "0.1.0" -> "0.1.1" -> "0.1.2";
      }
      group B {
        "0.2.0" -> "0.2.1" -> "0.2.2";
        "0.2.0" [label = "0.2.0\nNew features"]
      }
      group C {
        "1.0.0" [label = "1.0.0\nFirst stable", color = "green"];
        "1.0.0" -> "1.0.1";
      }
      "0.1.2" -> "0.2.0" [folded];
      "0.2.2" -> "1.0.0" [folded];
      "1.0.1" -> "2.0.0" [folded];
      "2.0.0" [label = "2.0.0\nIncompatible"];
    }
