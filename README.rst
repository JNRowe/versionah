Introduction
------------

``versionah`` is a simple tool to help you, or more specifically *me*, easily
maintain version information for a project.  Its entire aim is to make the act
of displaying or bumping a project's version number a thoughtless task.

It is written in Python, and released under the `GPL v3`_.

Requirements
------------

``versionah`` should run on Python_ v2.6 or newer [#]_, including Python v3.
The only external library ``versionah`` currently depends on is jinja_.  If
``versionah`` doesn't work with the version of Python you have installed, file
an issue_ and I'll endeavour to fix it.

If you would like coloured terminal output, then you will need blessings_.

.. [#] If you still run older Python versions only small changes should be
       required, for example the unrolling of conditional expressions and
       redefining of ``except..as`` structures.

Example
-------

The simplest way to show how ``versionah`` works is by example::

    $ versionah set example.txt 2.4.3
    2.4.3
    $ versionah display example.txt
    2.4.3
    $ versionah bump example.txt minor
    2.5.0
    $ versionah bump example.txt major
    3.0.0
    $ rm example.txt
    <BLANKLINE>

API Stability
-------------

API stability isn't guaranteed across versions, although frivolous changes won't
be made.

When ``versionah`` 1.0.0 is released the API will be frozen, and any changes
which aren't backwards compatible will force a major version bump.
