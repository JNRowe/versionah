``versionah`` - Simple version specification management
=======================================================

|travis| |coveralls| |pypi|

Introduction
------------

``versionah`` is a simple tool to help you — or more specifically *me* — easily
maintain version information for a project.  Its entire aim is to make the act
of displaying or bumping a project’s version number a thoughtless task.

It is written in Python, and released under the `GPL v3`_.

Requirements
------------

``versionah`` should run on Python_ v3.5 or newer.  The only external libraries
``versionah`` depends on are click_, jinja_ and jnrbase_.  If ``versionah``
doesn’t work with the version of Python you have installed, file an issue_ and
I’ll endeavour to fix it.

Example
-------

The simplest way to show how ``versionah`` works is by example:

.. code:: console

    $ versionah set example.txt 2.4.3
    2.4.3
    $ versionah display example.txt
    2.4.3
    $ versionah bump example.txt minor
    2.5.0
    $ versionah bump example.txt major
    3.0.0

API Stability
-------------

API stability isn’t guaranteed across versions, although frivolous changes won’t
be made.

When ``versionah`` 1.0.0 is released the API will be frozen, and any changes
which aren’t backwards compatible will force a major version bump.
