Introduction
------------

``versionah`` is a `GPL v3`_ licensed module for maintaining version information
files for use in project management.

Requirements
------------

``versionah`` should run on Python_ v2.6 or newer [#]_, including Python v3.
The only external library ``versionah`` currently depends on is jinja_.  If
``versionah`` doesn't work with the version of Python you have installed, file
an issue_ and I'll endeavour to fix it.

If you would like coloured terminal output, then you will need blessings_.

.. [#] If you still run older Python versions only small changes are required,
       for to support Python 2.5 only the print syntax and ``from __future__
       import print_function`` needs changing.

Example
-------

The simplest way to show how ``versionah`` works is by example::

    $ ./versionah.py -s 2.4.3 example.txt
    2.4.3
    $ ./versionah.py example.txt
    2.4.3
    $ ./versionah.py -b minor example.txt
    2.5.0
    $ ./versionah.py -b major example.txt
    3.0.0
    $ rm example.txt
    <BLANKLINE>

API Stability
-------------

API stability isn't guaranteed across versions, although frivolous changes won't
be made.

When ``versionah`` 1.0.0 is released the API will be frozen, and any changes
which aren't backwards compatible will force a major version bump.

------------

I'd like to thank the following people who have contributed to ``versionah``.
